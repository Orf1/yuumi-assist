# Yuumi Assist

Client/Server application to forward peripheral controls from one computer to another with the purpose of playing two LOL champions at once. Normal Account + Yuumi


**Steps to use:**

Compile yuumi-assist-server and yuumi-assist-client
Run server on main pc. Bind mouse buttons to the specific control keys (See below)
Run client on yuumi pc. Enter ip of pc with the server.

Control Keys:

- Insert - Q
- Home - E
- Page Up - W
- Del - R
- End - D
- Page Down - F

Mouse movement is mirrored from the server to the client. Also takes in account different monitor sizes and automatically scales it.


**Not 100% sure, but I believe this does not go against Riot Games tos since it is not playing for you, just mirroring imput commands from one pc to another.**
