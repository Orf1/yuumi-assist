# Use this program at your own risk. 

Since it is you taking the actions, not the program automatically, I don't believe it breaks tos, but use with caution.

"We don’t like applications that provide measurable player advantage. We’d like to set fair expectations by calling out some features that definitely aren’t okay. Some examples of measurable player advantage:

Exposing information that’s intentionally obfuscated (cooldowns or timers)
Taking actions on your behalf (botting or scripting)
Drawing conclusions for you (predicting enemy positions)
Altering your field of intelligence (zoomhacks or global ult alerts)"
